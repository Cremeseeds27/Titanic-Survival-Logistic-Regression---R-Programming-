# Titanic-Survival-Logistic-Regression-R
The purpose of this project is to use logistic regression to classify the given dataset and predict survival on the Titanic. The dataset is divided into three groups:

Training set (train.csv)
Test set (test.csv)
Gender set (gender_submission.csv)

A script written in R is used to classify the data using logistic regression. The training set is utilized to build the machine learning model, with the outcome provided for each passenger. The model is based on features such as passengers' gender and class. The test set is then used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and predict outcomes.
